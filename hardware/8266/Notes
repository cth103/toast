To program; pull GPIO0 low and reset (e.g. cycle power) then make flash (DON'T HAVE MINICOM OPEN!)
Using esp-open-sdk (from github/pfalcon)
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 to look at debug

Prototype uses about 76mA on the 5V line i.e. 380mW.  
8760 hours per year
Total kWh for a year (assuming 100% mains converter efficiency) 0.38 * 8760 / 1000 = 3.33kWh
@ 15p/unit this is 50p per year.

Ideas for improvements: swap GPIO0 with 2 so we don't need the PNP transistor dance; may fry DS18B20 if program link is made...?

Latching relay

3.3V relay & RAC01-3.3SC (100-240VAC -> 3.3V @ 300mA)
