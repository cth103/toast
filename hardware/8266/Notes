Board
Case
RECOM POWER RAC01-3.3SC 240V -> 3.3V max 300mA output Farnell 1903054
Fuse
Fuse holder e.g. RS 765-2973
Terminal block e.g. RS 193-0564

Relay something like RS 800-4502 (Â£1.55)

The trinket 3.3V rated current is 150mA but some people have the 8266
as drawing 215mA... may need another regulator.

Trinket is about 9mA

Could use LD1117V33 3.3v regulator; max output current 800mA, 1V-ish drop-out
RECOM POWER RAC02-05SC 5V, 400mA; enough for 8266 + trinket + loss

Arduino UI can program reliably; copy.sh can't (I think, or maybe it was adding
a USB hub that fixed it): go figure.
