To program:

select appropriate config with symlink
pull GPIO0 low and reset (e.g. cycle power) then make flash (DON'T HAVE MINICOM OPEN!)


Using esp-open-sdk (from github/pfalcon)
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 to look at debug

Prototype uses about 76mA on the 5V line i.e. 380mW.  
8760 hours per year
Total kWh for a year (assuming 100% mains converter efficiency) 0.38 * 8760 / 1000 = 3.33kWh
@ 15p/unit this is 50p per year.

Ideas for improvements: swap GPIO0 with 2 so we don't need the PNP transistor dance; may fry DS18B20 if program link is made...?

Latching relay

3.3V relay & RAC01-3.3SC (100-240VAC -> 3.3V @ 300mA)

DHT22 unreliability; fails when looking for the first response from the DHT22 after the microprocessor
sends the "start" signal.

Humidity ideas: SHT30 humidity sensor; I2C so needs 2x GPIO.
Options
 - hack GPIO onto ESP8266
 - I2C expander for relay (MCP23017 28-pin DIP, MCP23008 18-pin DIP, PCF8574 16-pin DIP, PCA9517 8-pin SOIC)
 - use another board e.g. ESP8266 03?
 - ditch humidity altogether and sense with temperature
 - use DS2438 and HIH-5030 e.g. http://rants.dyer.com.hk/rpi/humidity_1w.html (~£9 for HIH 5030, ~£5 for DS2438 and it's SOIC!)
